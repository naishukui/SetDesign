## Introduction

**SetDesign** is an R package designed to calculate the power of the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) when multi-allelic positions are present. It compares the simulated power between:

- **Separated Model**: Treating multi-allelic positions as two distinct SNPs.\
- **Combined Model**: Treating multi-allelic positions as a single combined SNP.\

The package also calculates the separated power using both the method described by Lee et al. and a more efficient method developed for this package. This functionality allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how multi-allelic positions impact power calculations.

Users can customize parameters such as:

- Number of subjects and SNPs.\
- Correlation between SNPs.\
- Significance level for the SKAT test.\
- Effect sizes of the two alternative alleles.\

The package supports both linear and binary outcomes, making it versatile for a wide range of genetic studies.

Suppose we want to calculate the power of the SKAT test for a binary outcome, assuming correlated SNPs and one multi-allelic position among `kk` SNPs.

```{r k2, eval = T, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(SKATmultiallele)

# Set number of  SNPs
kk = 50

# Set number of subjects
n = 2000

# Set significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Set correlation coefficient between SNPs
rho = 0.15

# Set minor allele frequency
p = 0.01

# Set effect sizes of the first alternative allele
list1=c(-0.1,-0.25,-0.5,-0.75,-0.9)

# Set effect sizes of the second alternative allele
list2=c(rep(0.5,5))

# Pairwise correlation
rho = 0.1

# get the power for SKAT test
powerD_derive(kk,n,p,alpha,list1,list2)
```
