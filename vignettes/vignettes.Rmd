## Introduction

**SetDesign** is an R package designed to calculate the power of the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT) when multi-allelic positions are present. It compares the simulated power between:

- **Separated Model**: Treating multi-allelic positions as two distinct SNPs.\
- **Combined Model**: Treating multi-allelic positions as a single combined SNP.\

The package also calculates the separated power using both the method described by Lee et al. and a more efficient method developed for this package. This functionality allows for a more comprehensive understanding of how multi-allelic positions impact power calculations.

Users can customize parameters such as:

- Number of subjects and SNPs.\
- Correlation between SNPs.\
- Significance level for the SKAT test.\
- Effect sizes of the two alternative alleles.\

The package supports both linear and binary outcomes, making it versatile for a wide range of genetic studies.



## Instructions for SetDesign Functions
The figures in simulation part can be generated following the steps here.


### Step 1

Submit batch job for snpC.R,snpCcor.R,snpD.R amd snpDcor.R. to get the simulation results for simulated power and theoretical power based on Lee's method.
Submit batch jobs for the following scripts to generate simulation results for both simulated and theoretical power:

- `snpC.R`: Linear outcomes without correlation.\
- `snpCcor.R`: Linear outcomes with correlation.\
- `snpD.R`: Binary outcomes without correlation.\
- `snpDcor.R`: Binary outcomes with correlation.\

Key parameters for these scripts:
- `n`: Total number of subjects.\
- `k`: Total number of SNPs.\
- `rho`: Correlation coefficient between SNPs.\
- `list1`: Vector of genetic effect sizes for the first alternative allele.\
- `list2`: Vector of genetic effect sizes for the second alternative allele.\


### Step 2

Run `results.R` to:
- Calculate theoretical power using the new method developed in this package.
- Generate plots comparing the four different power calculation methods across various effect size combinations.


Suppose we want to calculate the power of the SKAT test for a binary outcome, assuming correlated SNPs and one multi-allelic position among `kk` SNPs.

```{r k2, eval = T, echo=TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, error = FALSE}
library(SKATmultiallele)

# Set number of  SNPs
kk = 50

# Set number of subjects
n = 2000

# Set significance level
alpha = 0.05

# Set correlation coefficient between SNPs
rho = 0.15

# Set minor allele frequency
p = 0.01

# Set effect sizes of the first alternative allele
list1=c(-0.1,-0.25,-0.5,-0.75,-0.9)

# Set effect sizes of the second alternative allele
list2=c(rep(0.5,5))

# Pairwise correlation
rho = 0.1

# get the power for SKAT test
powerD_derive(kk,n,p,alpha,list1,list2)
```
